# $pur
### A new way to grow

$pur is an app designed to allow for easy self promotion to the general public. Specifically catering to small businesses that lack exposure and online presence. 
The app is made in Flutter with a node.js backend and mongodb database. App is primarily for mobile use.

# What is does
Spur uses QR codes to generate and display information regarding local businesses or other promotions. Users can create their own QR code by entering basic information about their promotion: a name, a brief description, a website URL, and an image to go with it. This data is used to generate a QR code which is stored on our MongoDB database. Users can scan a QR code in the app through our main menu, and provided that QR code is in the database, the app will display the information associated with the promotion, in addition to a “visit counter” which tells the user the number of times that promotion’s QR code has been scanned. Both the generating and scanning processes are very quick and user-friendly, allowing users to jump right in!
